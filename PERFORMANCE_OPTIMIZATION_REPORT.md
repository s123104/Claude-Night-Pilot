## ðŸš€ Performance Optimization Implementation

This report documents the comprehensive performance optimizations implemented for Claude Night Pilot to address parallel processing and test timeout issues.

## ðŸ“Š Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Rust Compilation & Runtime Optimizations

**Cargo.toml Enhancements:**
- **Release Profile**: Upgraded from `opt-level = "s"` to `opt-level = 3` for maximum performance

- **Test Profile**: Increased `opt-level = 2` with optimized debug settings
- **Dev Profile**: Enhanced parallel compilation with `codegen-units = 16`
- **LTO**: Maintained `lto = "fat"` for comprehensive link-time optimization

**New Performance Dependencies:**
```toml
dashmap = "6.1"                        # High-performance concurrent HashMap
arc-swap = "1.7"                       # Lock-free atomic reference counting  
parking_lot = "0.12"                   # Faster synchronization primitives
rayon = "1.10"                         # Data parallelism for CPU-bound work
r2d2 = "0.8"                          # Connection pooling
r2d2_sqlite = "0.25"                  # SQLite connection pool adapter
flume = "0.11"                         # Multi-producer, multi-consumer channels
```

**Database Indexes Added:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_prompts_created_at ON prompts(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_prompts_tags ON prompts(tags) WHERE tags IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_schedules_status_time ON schedules(status, schedule_time);
CREATE INDEX idx_schedules_next_run ON schedules(next_run_at) WHERE next_run_at IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_execution_results_schedule_id ON execution_results(schedule_id);
```

### 3. Enhanced Playwright Test Configuration

**Optimized Settings:**

- **Increased Timeouts**: 
  - Action timeout: 15s (from 10s)
  - Navigation timeout: 45s (from 30s)
  - Test timeout: 120s (from 60s)
- **Browser Optimization**: Added performance-focused Chrome args:
  ```javascript
  args: [
    '--disable-web-security',
    '--disable-features=TranslateUI',
    '--disable-ipc-flooding-protection',
    '--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows',
    '--disable-renderer-backgrounding',
    '--disable-background-timer-throttling',
    '--no-sandbox',
    '--memory-pressure-off',
  ]
  ```

**Project-Level Parallelization:**
