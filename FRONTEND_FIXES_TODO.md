# Frontend E2E Test Fixes - Progress Tracker

## âœ… Completed Tasks

1. **Tauri 2.0 API Integration** - Fixed API client to properly detect and use Tauri 2.0 API
   - Updated APIClient class with proper initialization
   - Added fallback to legacy Tauri 1.x API
   - Implemented proper error handling and mock fallbacks

2. **UnifiedApiClient Refactoring** - Standardized all API calls through unified interface
   - Consolidated all Tauri command invocations
   - Added proper command detection and routing
   - Enhanced mock responses for all service APIs

3. **App Initialization Enhancement** - Fixed DOM loading and app ready state
   - Enhanced MaterialAppInitializer with better error handling
   - Added proper DOM element checking and fallbacks
   - Improved loading sequence with actual validation steps
   - Added emergency fallback for failed initialization

4. **Enhanced Test Helpers** - Improved test reliability and debugging
   - Updated waitForAppReady with comprehensive checks
   - Added debug logging and fallback detection
   - Improved error reporting for failed tests

5. **Mock System Overhaul** - Complete mock API system for tests
   - Enhanced Claude CLI mocking with Tauri 2.0 support
   - Added comprehensive service API mocks
   - Improved mock response timing and reliability

## ðŸ”„ In Progress

6. **Testing Data Flow** - Need to verify complete API response chain
   - Check PromptManager.loadPrompts() error handling
   - Verify JobManager API integration
   - Test CooldownManager status updates

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks

7. **Database Mock Integration** - Ensure database operations work in test mode
   - Mock Tauri database commands
   - Handle async database initialization
   - Test data persistence across page reloads

8. **Error Boundary Implementation** - Add proper error boundaries for UI components
   - Catch and handle API failures gracefully
   - Show user-friendly error messages
   - Prevent complete app crashes

9. **CSS/Animation Fixes** - Ensure styles load properly in test environment
   - Fix Material Design component rendering
   - Handle animation timing in tests
   - Ensure responsive design works

10. **Test Environment Setup** - Optimize test configuration
    - Reduce test timeouts where possible
    - Improve test isolation
    - Add better test data cleanup

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

- [ ] `.app-container` element renders properly in tests
- [ ] API client returns proper responses (not undefined)
- [ ] E2E tests pass without timeout errors
- [ ] Frontend loads correctly in both development and test modes
- [ ] All CRUD operations work through the API layer
- [ ] Error handling works properly for failed API calls

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps

1. Run E2E tests to verify current fixes
2. Address any remaining API response issues
3. Fix database initialization in test environment
4. Optimize test performance and reliability
